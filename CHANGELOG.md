## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.0] - 2024-07-07

### Fixed

* Place `<key>` tags before nodes and edges (#53, #57)

    The graphml spec requires the key tags to be emitted first, which was not done.
    This change means the output is now usable by more programs.

    Thanks to @Shadetheartist for providing the PR.
